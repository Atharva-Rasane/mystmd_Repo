The current `mystjs` will be extracted from the [curvenote](https://curvenote.com/docs/cli/installing) command-line tool in October 2022.

To use the functionality in `mystjs` before then, [install the open-source `curvenote`](https://curvenote.com/docs/cli/installing) tool. There are some differences in that tool than what is documented here, when in doubt, use the `-h` in the command line!
